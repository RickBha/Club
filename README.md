A to-do list in which a user has the ability to add, delete and modify tasks as per their requirement.
This is a very basic program with 4 functionalities - 
  1. Add tasks
  2. Checkboxes for completed tasks
  3. Delete tasks
  4. Save (automatic)
The program is made in Python, using two modules - Tkinter, and Json :
  1. JSON is used to store and retrieve tasks in a structured format.
  2. Tkinter is used to run the program in a window.
